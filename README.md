## Arduino MIDI Drum Pads ##
## README ##
Hardware Components Used:
•	Arduino Nano
•	Piezo Electric Transducers
Softwares on PC:
•	LoopMIDI
•	HairlessMIDI
•	DAW on PC
HairlessMIDI is used to read the Serial Data from the Arduino and convert that into meaningful MIDI data for the LoopMIDI software.
LoopMIDI creates a virtual MIDI port on your PC that interfaces with the DAW software and HairlessMIDI

## A recent Arduino Library is available which makes it posibble to use the native USB port on the Arduino as  MIDI interface ##
